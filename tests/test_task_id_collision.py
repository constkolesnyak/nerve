"""``task_create`` must never write over an existing task.

A task ID is ``<date>-<slug>`` where the slug is the title truncated to 40
characters. Two titles that differ only past that cut therefore produce the
same ID on the same day -- and the handler used to write it out regardless:
``write_text`` truncated the older task's markdown to the new body, and
``upsert_task`` rewrote that same row's title, status and content. Both copies
of the older task were gone, and the tool still answered ``Task created``.

The duplicate check does not cover this. It reports *similar* tasks and offers
``confirm_duplicate=true``, which was the one flag that skipped straight past
the report into the overwrite. Confirming a duplicate means "create a second
task", so a taken ID now moves the new task to the next free suffix.

Each collision test asserts up front that the two titles really do share a base
ID. Without that a change to the slug rule would make them pass while testing
nothing.
