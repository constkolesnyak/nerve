 * written last in the `class` attribute. On class order alone a primitive beats
 * its own callers at whatever it sets: `size="xs"` with a caller's `px-0` would
 * render `px-2`, and `size="sm"` with `text-sm` would render `text-xs`.
 *
 * This drops the defaults that the override contradicts, so the escape hatch the
 * props cannot cover behaves the way its name implies.

 * whole string through `twMerge` in one go would be shorter, and would also
 * quietly resolve collisions *between* the variant and size tables, which is
 * what `Button.test.tsx` checks for. Those tables must never emit two of the
 * same property, and a duplicate inside them must reach the DOM where the test
 * can see it. Filtering per default class keeps both properties: internal
 * duplicates survive untouched, and only the caller displaces anything.
