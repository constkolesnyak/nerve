 * tooltip, and as `aria-label`, so the control has a name at all. That is the
 * point of the component: an icon-only button with no `aria-label` announces as
 * "button" and nothing else, and a required prop makes that impossible.
 *
 * Not Click UI's `IconButton`, which picks its glyph by name from a closed
 * union of Click UI icons. This app's icons are components (see `icons.tsx`),
 * and several of these buttons swap their icon by state — a spinner while
 * busy, the action's glyph otherwise. Taking the icon as children covers both.
