/**
 * A dropdown, on the native `<select>`.
 *
 * Click UI's `Select` is the richer control — it is searchable, groupable and
 * styleable — but it is not a drop-in here, for two reasons beyond the obvious
 * one that its API is `onSelect(value)` rather than `onChange(e)`:
 *
 * **It portals.** Radix renders the open list into `document.body`. Three of
 * this app's selects live inside a `Modal`, whose focus trap only knows about
 * nodes inside its own panel and whose Escape handler runs on the capture phase
 * — so an open Click UI list inside a dialog would be untabbable, and Escape
 * would close the dialog instead of the list. Making that work means teaching
 * the Modal about Radix's layer stack.
 *
 * **It is not a native control.** This app is used on a phone (the whole
 * `PageHeader` breakpoint story exists for that reason), and a native `<select>`
 * gets the platform's own picker there.
 *
 * So: use this for the app's plain selects. Reach for Click UI's `Select`
 * directly when one needs search or option groups — and keep it out of dialogs
 * until the Modal knows about Radix layers.
