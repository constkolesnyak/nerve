 * is ever on the element.
 *
 * That is not tidiness, it is the only thing that works. Tailwind v4 emits
 * same-property utilities in alphabetical order of class name, so between two
 * colour classes on one element the later-*sorting* name wins — not the one
 * written last, and not the one from the "more specific" map. `.text-accent`
 * sorts before every other colour token in this app; measured in the built
 * stylesheet it lands at offset 49085, against `.text-hue-red` 51903,
 * `.text-on-accent` 52978, `.text-text-dim` 53924, `.text-text-faint` 53967,
 * `.text-text-muted` 54167, `.text-text-secondary` 54214 and `.text-white`
 * 54310. An accent `ACTIVE` appended after a coloured base therefore loses,
 * silently, and a `border-transparent` in the base outsorts, and so beats,
 * `ACTIVE.tab`'s `border-accent`.
 *
 * `overridable` does not rescue this. It resolves the *caller's* `className`
 * against these tables and deliberately leaves collisions between the tables
 * themselves in place, so that they still reach the DOM where the test can see
 * them. `Button.test.tsx` pins the invariant.

   * switch is exactly that shape). A `hover:bg-surface-raised` segment would
   * then be hovering to the colour it is already on, and the control would go
   * dead.
   *
   * `surface-hover` rather than `surface-raised` is better, but it does not
   * rescue that case on its own, so it is no reason to drop the text move. Both
   * are `color-mix` of the same two near-neutral greys: `surface-raised` is
   * 50/50, `surface-hover` is 25/75. In dark those inputs are #282828 and

   * (#f6f7fa, #e6e7e9) roughly 4. On a raised parent that step is essentially
   * invisible, and the text is the only thing the eye actually gets. A
   * genuinely distinct surface step would need a token the palette does not
   * have.
   *
   * The text moves *up* from the resting colour rather than the resting colour
   * moving down: dimming ~71 list rows at rest to buy a hover state on one
   * segmented control would be a bad trade. Both hovers are `hover:`-prefixed,
   * so they carry a pseudo-class and sit outside the ordering hazard on ACTIVE
