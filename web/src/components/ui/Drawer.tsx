/**
 * Off-canvas panel over a tap-to-dismiss scrim.
 *
 * Stays mounted while closed so the slide has something to animate, and
 * carries `inert` in that state so a panel parked off-screen cannot be
 * reached by tab or read by a screen reader.
 *
 * While open it is a modal, and `useModalSurface` gives it the matching
 * keyboard contract: focus moves in, Tab cycles inside instead of walking onto
 * the page behind it, Escape closes it — claimed here, so it stops short of the
 * global Escape shortcut that halts a streaming response — and focus goes back
 * to whatever opened it. Callers should still put a visible close control in
 * their header; Escape alone is not discoverable.
 *
 * `side` distinguishes the two jobs navigation does on a phone: `left` for
 * "which item within this section" (the chat session list), `right` for
 * "which section of the app" (the nav overflow behind More).
