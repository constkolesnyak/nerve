        Picks up added / removed / rescheduled / enabled-toggled jobs without a

          * jobs removed or newly disabled → unscheduled
          * every other enabled job        → rebuilt from the new definition

        Every enabled job is rebuilt, not only the ones whose YAML changed.
        Rebuilding a trigger keeps the next fire time as it was for a crontab
        job, and for an interval job anchored to a successful run; an interval
        job that has never succeeded has no anchor and restarts its countdown,
        which is the only thing this costs (documented in docs/cron.md).

        Source runners and the fixed cleanup/wakeup jobs are left untouched.
        Custom gate plugins are re-read from scratch (replace=True): a new file
        registers, an edited file's code takes effect, and a deleted file's gate
        unregisters (see nerve/cron/gate_plugins.py). Rebuilding every job is
        what puts those gates in front of the jobs that run: the scheduler
        executes the CronJob object it holds, and gates are built into that
        object when it is constructed.

        All-or-nothing: the complete change set — every trigger included — is
        built before the scheduler is touched, so a reload the daemon cannot
        carry out raises with the running schedule exactly as it was. That
        covers the gate registry too; see :meth:`_reload_locked`.

        Serialized via a lock so concurrent callers (sync loop, HTTP routes)
        can't interleave scheduler mutations. The two properties are
        separate: the lock keeps two reloads from overlapping, and the planning
        pass keeps a single failing one from applying half of itself.

        Returns a summary dict: ``{"added", "removed", "updated", "enabled",
        "rejected"}``. ``updated`` is every enabled job that already had a
        trigger — it says what the reload rescheduled, not which jobs the file
        changed. ``enabled`` counts jobs that are scheduled, not jobs whose YAML
        says ``enabled: true``; ``rejected`` names the ids the loader refused
        because the daemon reserves them, which would otherwise be the one class
        of job that disappears from the reload without the reload mentioning it.
