"""V31: Session wakeups (ScheduleWakeup harness).

Adds a ``session_wakeups`` table that records self-scheduled wakeups
requested by the model via the ``ScheduleWakeup`` tool.

Background: the bundled Claude CLI fires ``ScheduleWakeup`` autonomously
inside its own subprocess, but Nerve only reads the SDK message stream
during an active ``engine.run()`` — so an autonomously-fired wakeup turn
lands in an unread buffer and then desyncs the next real turn. The fix
disables the CLI's own firing (``CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON=1``) and makes
Nerve the harness: a PostToolUse hook records the request here, and a
periodic sweep fires it via ``engine.run(..., source="wakeup")``.

One-shot only. ``ScheduleWakeup`` is always a one-shot wakeup; if the
model wants to keep a loop alive it re-calls the tool each turn, which
re-inserts a fresh row. Recurring crons are intentionally NOT supported
here — Nerve has its own cron system and the CLI cron tools are removed.
