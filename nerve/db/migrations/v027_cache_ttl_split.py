"""V27: Split cache_creation tokens by TTL (5-minute vs 1-hour).

The Anthropic API returns ``cache_creation: {ephemeral_5m_input_tokens,
ephemeral_1h_input_tokens}`` alongside the legacy aggregate
``cache_creation_input_tokens``. The two TTLs are billed at different
rates (5m write = 1.25x base, 1h write = 2x base), so accurate cost
attribution requires tracking them separately.

This migration adds two columns to ``session_usage``. Existing rows
default to 0 — historical aggregates remain in
``cache_creation_input_tokens`` and can still be summed.

History note: this was originally numbered v027 but collided with
``v900_session_last_rotated``. The previous migration runner tracked
only ``MAX(version)``, so on databases where the *other* v027 was
applied first this one was silently skipped, breaking usage tracking
end-to-end. Renumbering to v030 lets the runner pick it up again on
already-migrated databases; the check below makes the migration
idempotent for DBs that were hand-patched in the interim.
