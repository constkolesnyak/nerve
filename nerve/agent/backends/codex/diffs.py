"""Reverse-apply unified diffs — pre-image reconstruction for snapshots.

The live probe (scripts/codex_smoke.py, 2026-07-10) showed the real
app-server emits ``item/started`` for fileChange items *after* the patch
is applied to disk, so snapshotting the file at that point captures the
NEW content — useless for the UI's before/after diff panel. But codex
hands us the unified diff of every change, so the pre-image is
recoverable: reverse-apply the diff to the post-apply content.

The verification-first design makes timing irrelevant:

* post-apply timing → reverse-apply succeeds → true pre-image;
* pre-apply timing (e.g. ``approval_policy: on-request``, where the
  request precedes the write) → the disk still holds the before-text, the
  reverse application fails its context checks → caller falls back to the
  disk content, which IS the pre-image.

Every hunk line is verified against the text it claims to describe;
any mismatch returns ``None`` (never a silently wrong reconstruction).
