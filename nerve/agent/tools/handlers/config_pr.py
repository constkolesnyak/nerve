"""Tool handler: propose_config_change — open a PR against the workspace repo.

This is how the agent changes its own configuration (skills, cron, settings)
when it can't edit the live workspace directly — always under lockdown, and the
recommended reviewed path otherwise. See the `nerve-workspace` skill.
