"""Atomic file writer for external-agent config and memory files.

Why a dedicated writer:

- **Allowlist enforcement.** Only paths under ``~/.codex``, ``~/.claude``,
  or ``~/.cursor`` are writable. The wizard and the sync cron run with
  full user privileges; a bug that pointed at ``/etc/passwd`` should
  fail loudly, not destroy the host.
- **Conflict policy.** ``backup`` saves a timestamped copy of the
  existing file before overwriting; ``skip`` leaves the original in
  place and returns ``None``; ``merge`` deep-merges JSON dicts (Claude
  Code's ``settings.json`` is the canonical use case — we want to add
  an ``mcpServers`` block without nuking the user's model/plugin
  preferences).
- **Atomic write.** Writes go via temp file + ``rename`` so a SIGTERM
  mid-write doesn't leave half-baked config on disk.
- **Idempotency.** Hash sidecar (``<output>.nerve-hash``) records the
  hash we wrote so the sync cron can skip no-op writes.
